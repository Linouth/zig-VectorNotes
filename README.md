# zig-VectorNotes

Reimplementation of my C based [VectorNotes application](https://github.com/Linouth/VectorNotes).

A super simple note taking application using vector based drawing.

## Todo

Some lists for me to pick from when I want to work on this project.

### Essentials

- [x] Port my C program to Zig
- [x] Undo/Redo system
- [ ] Better tools implementation
- [ ] Selection tool
- [ ] Deletion tool
- [ ] Map 0 to 1 parameters to a whole bezier Path and evaluate the path
- [ ] Only render paths in view
- [ ] Don't render paths zoomed out too far
- [ ] Save/load system
- [ ] Extract NanoVG wrapper into a separate library

### Future

- [ ] PDF viewer
- [ ] Export to different file formats
- [ ] Custom vector drawing library, with support for variable stroke widths
